# Bingo-with-Python
We would like you to develop software that will create the bingo cards that we will use, along with analytical predictions of how the party will run.

The typical rules of the game of Bingo are as follows:

1. Each participant has a card with a grid of numbers;
2. At given intervals, a number between 1 and 75 is called, and all participants whose cards contain that number can cross it out;
3. Whenever a player has a full line, column or diagonal of crossed-out numbers, they call out \BINGO!", and returns their card to the organisers, in exchange for a prize.
4. All the players that have not reached BINGO yet keep playing, until either they fill a line/col/diagonal, or when the organisers stop calling out numbers.

A Bingo card has the following characteristics:

1. It is composed of a 5x5 grid of numbers;
2. The first column contains numbers from 1-15, the second one from 16-30, the third one from 31-45, the fourth one from 46-60, and the fifth one from 61-75.
3. The central cell of the grid is a \free cell".
